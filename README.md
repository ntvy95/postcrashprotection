Date of creation: Jul 05, 2015.

I once put all of my phpBB extensions into one GitHub respository when I was a GitHub newbie. I am re-committing them for separate repositories.

# What is this?

A phpBB extension will auto-save people's editing posts every certain time invertal. Database is involved.

Ported from [4_seven's MOD](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=434&t=2099750).

Tested on phpBB 3.1.9.

# Installation

- Download the zip file.
- Extract them to ext folder, directory structure: ext/koutogima/postcrashprotection.
- Remember to move all the files (the folder itself is not included) in COPY_THESE_FILES_TO_ROOT folder to root folder.
- ACP -> Customise -> Enable "Post Crash Proctection".

Note: It also works with quick reply (not so sure with the original quick reply but quite sure with this [QuickReply extension](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=456&t=2259196))
This is my first extension with little knowledge of PHP so I will be very grateful if anyone can point a way that no need to move files from [COPY_THESE_FILES_TO_ROOT folder](COPY_THESE_FILES_TO_ROOT) to root folder.
